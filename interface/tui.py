# Chess TUI
#
# This file contains a terminal user interface for displaying python-chess boards.
# Entering moves like this is very tedious, I definitely recommend using the GUI!
#
# Note: By default, my terminal in Pycharm did not display the board correctly with Jetbrains default font.
#   Courier New, Consolas, Lucida Sans Typewriter, everything else works fine.
#   (File -> Settings -> Editor -> Colors Scheme -> Console Font)
